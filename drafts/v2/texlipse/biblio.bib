	an incident light beam can produce an intensity- or flux-dependent
	change in the refractive index and absorption coefficient of different
	materials. Whenever possible, the mechanisms are initially traced
	to single-atom and -molecule effects in order to provide physical
	understanding. Representative values are given for the various mechanisms.
	Nine different mechanisms are discussed, starting with the Kerr effect
	due to atoms and/or molecules with discrete states, including organic
	materials such as molecules and conjugated polymers. Simplified two
	and/or three-level models provide useful information, and these are
	summarized. The nonlinear optics of semiconductors is reviewed for
	both bulk and quantum-confined semiconductors, focusing on the most
	common types II-VI and III-V. Also discussed in some detail are the
	different nonlinear mechanisms that occur in liquid crystals and
	photorefractive media. Additional nonlinear material systems and
	mechanisms such as glasses, molecular reorientation of single molecules,
	the electrostrictive effect, the nuclear effect (vibrational contributions),
	cascading, and the ever-present thermal effects are quantified, and
	representative tables of values are given.},

  abstract = {It is sometimes necessary to determine the manner in which structures
	deteriorate with respect to time; for instance when quantifying a

	This paper addresses some practical limitations of Fourier analysis

	with extracting variations in modal parameters. The statistical analysis
	of numerous numerical experiments shows how techniques, such as data
	overlapping and zero-padding, can be used to improve the sensitivity

  abstract = {The fast Fourier transform algorithm uses two properties of the discrete
	Fourier transform to decrease the number of computations. The first
	property is that the kernel for the Fourier transform is periodic.
	The second property is the shift rule, The shift rule of the Fourier
	transform states that shifting a function in the time domain corresponds
	to multiplying the function in the frequency domain by a complex
	exponential factor. The Hartley transform has similar properties
	to the Fourier transform. The Hartley kernel is periodic, and shifting
	a function in the time domain corresponds to the two multiplications
	in the frequency domain. Due to the properties of the discrete Hartley
	transform, a fast Hartley transform algorithm can be based on the
	algorithm of the fast Fourier transform. Since the fast Hartley transform
	can work with only real numbers, the transform requires half of the
	multiplication of a similar FFT. The transform and other operations
	in Hartley space take less computing time than corresponding operations
